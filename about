Title: "Contact Form with Data Saving to Firebase Database"

Description: This is a React component named "Contact" that represents a contact form 
for users to submit their information. The form collects the user's name, email, mobile 
number, address, and a message. The data entered by the user is saved to a Firebase Realtime 
Database using an asynchronous function called "postData."

How It Works:
1. The component uses the `useState` hook to initialize a state variable called `user` to store the form data.
2. As the user enters data in each input field, the `getUserData` function captures the field's name and value
and updates the `user` state accordingly.
3. When the "Register" button is clicked, the `postData` function is called.
4. The function first checks if all the required fields (name, email, mobile, address, and message) are filled out.
If any field is missing, it displays an alert to prompt the user to fill in all the data.
5. If all the fields are filled out, the function makes a POST request to the Firebase Realtime Database API to save 
the user data using the `fetch` function.
6. Upon successful data saving, the form is reset, and an alert is displayed to inform the user that the data was saved successfully.

Note: The form is styled using CSS classes, and it is designed to have user-friendly input fields with placeholders and 
validation for required fields. The form data is sent to Firebase using a POST request with JSON data in the request body.
